# Cookout Brand Awareness

Cookout is a brand that as been estabilished since 1984 it has gone through two new branding updates but has never had a website of it's own. It's a McLoughlinsRS own brand one of Ireland largest retail distributors of Gardening Homewares and DIY in Ireland. Cookout is sold on the B2B website but there is no information background about the product that can be shared with the customer via it's own site or being shared on retailers websites via a link. Therfore creating more brand awarness and creating customer awareness and loyalty.  

I hope this website will inspire people to get cooking outdoors and use the Cookout brand while doing so. Keeping with the brand colors and theme an website that is easy to navigate and not taxing on the user.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all five pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to, Home page, Where to Buy and Recipe page giving someting free to the user in the form a BBQ recipe and digital book to download.
  - This allows the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button as its not always a good this to depend on the back button.

- __The landing page image__

  - Main landing page includes a light intro and brand logo, background image allows brand logo to stand out off page. 
  - Product images are shown on this page to show what is on offer from the brand. Information on products is short and concise.
  - This page is long, so I have included click down and up buttons. 
  - Social media icons are only included on the first page, otherwise I feel the user will go down rabbit hole. I want to keep the user on website.
  - On footer the address on supplier company exsist and is cliable to be taken to suppliers website.

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for the Supplier of the brand 'Cookout'. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Adding more new products and new recipe ideas

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

###In order for someone to access I must deploy site to Github from Gitpod the container-based development platform I have been using: 
  - Make sure that I have "git added", "git commit -m" & "git push" to Github
  - Once in Github, I selected in my repositories the one that I wanted to deloy, select settings scroll down to the github pages section heading.
  - Selected source, clicked none, then selected "main". This refers to  Git branch.
  - Scroll back down to Github pages section to get my deployed link.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
