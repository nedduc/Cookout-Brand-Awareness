# Cookout Brand Awareness

Cookout is a brand that as been estabilished since 1984 it has gone through two new branding updates but has never had a website of it's own. It's a McLoughlinsRS own brand one of Ireland largest retail distributors of Gardening Homewares and DIY in Ireland. Cookout is sold on the B2B website but there is no information background about the product that can be shared with the customer via it's own site or being shared on retailers websites via a link. Therfore creating more brand awarness and creating customer awareness and loyalty.  

I hope this website will inspire people to get cooking outdoors and use the Cookout brand while doing so. Keeping with the brand colors and theme a website that is easy to navigate and not taxing on the user.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all five pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to, Home page, Where to Buy and Recipe page giving someting free to the user in the form a BBQ recipe and digital book to download. The nav bar was made sticky so that on longer scrolling pages and mobile it was visable at all times.
  - This allows the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button as its not always a good thing to depend on. 
  - Also added an active selector to each on the header when on page, like a felt tip pen mark.

- __The landing page image__

  - Main landing page includes a light intro and brand logo, background image allows brand logo to stand out off page. 
  - Product images are shown on this page to show category offering from the brand. Information on products is short and concise.
  - This page is long, so I have included click down and up buttons. 
  - Social media icons are only included on the first page, otherwise I feel the user will go down rabbit hole. I want to keep the user on website.
  - On footer the address on supplier company exsist and is clickable to be taken to distrubutors website.

- __Where to Buy__

  - This page shows the user where to buy the products. 
  - There is a link included to Retailer E-Shop as the company does not sell directly to consumer.

- __Recipe__

  - This section will allow the user to see exactly when the meetups will happen, where they will be located and how long the run will be in kilometers. 
  - This section will be updated as these times change to keep the user up to date.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for the Supplier of the brand 'Cookout'. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - Social media icons are only on main index.html page. The idea behind this is to direct the user around the website finding out about the brand.

### Features Left to Implement

- Adding more new products and new recipe ideas. Once the user signs up for the recipe book, they are not a cold call anymore
and can be contacted with new products and more recipe ideas.
- Links can be added to 'Where to Buy' page on logo's to take user directly to purchse page for product.

## Testing 

While in the Dev Tools I used the rsponsive tools to view site on iPad and iPhone5 I also opened on my own Samsung 6
as well as seeing it my iMac. I left one or two items uncentered and this created a nice pause for the eye and flow 
of reading.(you can get bored travelling in a straight line all the time i.e motorway driving)

All my links work to other websites and internal pages. Screen shots of all testing available in Testing folder.

It has performed the way I wanted it to on different browsers and screen sizes.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - I have passed all my html pages on W3 HTML Validator and all pages have finally received a document checking completed with no errors or warnings to show. Main errors were rogue tags and alt information added into links that did not need to be there. [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - I also used W3 Jigsaw Validator to pass my css file, I had 9 errors and 1 warning which all have been resolved. [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

I did not center a heading on the recipe page as I think the page reads better, it has a nice flow. White space can be important.
Unfixed bug was a user agent stylesheet that I believe is in chrome. 

## Deployment

###In order for someone to access I must deploy site to Github from Gitpod the container-based development platform I have been using:

  - Optionally, use the drop-down menu to select a folder for my publishing source.
  - Waited for page to refresh.
